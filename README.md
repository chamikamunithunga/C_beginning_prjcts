### Summary
Added a new quicksort algorithm implementation in C to improve sorting efficiency for large datasets.

### Changes
- Implemented quicksort in `quicksort.c`
- Updated `main.c` to include quicksort as an option for sorting arrays.
- Fixed minor bugs in the existing bubble sort implementation.

### Related Issues
- Resolves issue #42 regarding sorting inefficiency.

### Testing
- Tested the quicksort function with arrays of varying sizes.
- Verified sorting accuracy by comparing outputs with the bubble sort results.

### Notes
- The quicksort implementation has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average case.
